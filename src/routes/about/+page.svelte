<h1>| Experience</h1>
<div class="section">
<div class="splittext">
I have extensive classroom experience, as a parent, student and teacher.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>As a parent,</b> I have four children in PAUSD, ranging from 1st Grade to High School. I have served as: Palo Alto High School TEAM Communications VP (2023-24), JLS Connections Board President (2020-23), and Ohlone PTA President (2022-24), as well as a host of other roles (Communications, Treasurer, etc.) and as a Room Parent since 2009.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>As a student,</b> I have seven degrees in a range of academic disciplines. I am familiar with a wide range of pedagogical methods and delights in finding creative and innovative ways to learn or teach new concepts. My passion for education is evident.
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>BA in English Literature (Oxford University) (1993-96)</li>
<li>MA in English Literature (Oxford University) (1996-97)</li>
<li>MBA in Corporate Finance (London Business School) (2022-04)</li>
<li>Postgraduate Diploma in Law (PgDL) (College Of Law, London) (1998-2002)</li>
<li>Legal Practice Course (LPC) (BPP Law School, London) (2002-06)</li>
<li>MSc in International Management For China (SOAS, London) (2001-02)</li>
<li>PhD in Anthropology & Culture (incomplete) (SOAS, London) (2001-06)</li>
</ul><br/>
<b>As a teacher,</b> I have taught in Palo Alto classrooms from preschool to post-graduate, from volunteering at parent participation preschool to teaching students about #MeToo. Additionally, I have taught disadvantaged youth across Africa, Asia, and in inner-city London, where I worked at a media center, teaching filmmaking to high school dropouts.

<h1>| Empathy</h1>
<div class="section">
I seek to bring empathy, fairness, honesty and transparency to the school board.<br/><br/>
<b>As a #MeToo activist,</b> sexual assault and suicide survivor, I am deeply empathetic and all too familiar with navigating difficult, sensitive, and taboo subjects. I am an expert in bringing many diverse voices to the table, ensuring everyone is equally and fairly listened to, and in finding creative solutions that then benefit the greatest number of stakeholders.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>As a PTA President,</b> I have advocated as a spokesperson for disenfranchised parents, students, and teachers, who came forward with a range of contentious issues, and often felt frustrated or stonewalled. I have worked tirelessly to ease tensions in difficult situations and to find acceptable compromises. I am committed to putting people first and foremost.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>And, finally, as a human being, </b>I have devoted my life to advocating for those less fortunate than myself, from my poverty alleviation work with clients in Africa who live on less than $1 Per Day, to my #MeToo advocacy work with fellow sexual assault survivors of color, who cannot advocate for themselves, due to finance, immigration, or language.
</div>
<h1>| Engagement</h1>
<div class="section">
<b>As a community resident, </b>I am deeply embedded in Palo Alto, through various roles ranging from running a local Buy Nothing Group to serving as a Girl Scout Troop Leader.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>As a community volunteer, </b>I have been involved with a host of activities including: beach cleaning, clothing closets, food bank distribution, holiday gift wrapping, and tree planting.
